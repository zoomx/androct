#Answers of Google Summer of Code with MIT App Inventor

# Answers of Application Form: Summer of Code with MIT App Inventor #

## Interest in App Inventor ##
App Inventor really appeals to me a great deal.
I'm very interested in Mobile Internet, I commenced studying mobile development in 2010. App Inventor is a google labs' project at that time, and I began to use App Inventor as soon as it publicly released. App Inventor is very useful to a beginner, it has a graphical interface, what you need to do is just drag-and-drop, it's so easy to use. <br />
As a developer, most of the time I use Eclipse and Android SDK, and type code to create Android apps, but so many people, who doesn't know much about programming or computer technology, wants to create apps on this amazing mobile system. One of the greatest attractions of App Inventor is that we can help people. Anyone who can create Android apps so long as he or she has a creative, herein will lie the most important meaning of App Inventor.

## Proposed summer project ##
Android and App Inventor are of great interest to me, so I do hope to do my bit for App Inventor. I have a great deal of experience in Java and Android development, so I want to join the first area which is extending App Inventor's capabilities to include more features of the Android platform.

## Interest in introductory programming ##
I have wide experience in mobile development and won some awards in this area. I have developed many apps on every popular mobile system, include Android, and programed in Java, Objective-C, C#, HTML5, etc. I like to discuss programming problems and share IT news with my schoolmates, and also be very happy to introduce programming language and development tools to others.

## Experience with the development tools ##
I have developed many apps on iOS, Android, & Windows Phone. On Android platform, I won a 3rd prize in _Google 2011 Android Application Development Chinese College Students’ Challenge_, and our Android project @here won The Most Practical Value Award ( top 3%) in _2nd Shenzhen-Hong Kong-Macau-Taiwan University Students Creative Plan Championship_. <br />
I have used App Inventor to develop some simple apps, such as AndRoct. AndRoct is a simple game built by App Inventor, it used Button, Canvas, Clock, Label, Ball, ImageSprite, AccelerometerSensor, Screen Arrangement, etc. Indeed the performance is not very well, but it shows what we can do. App Inventor, from a developer perspective, has a lot of questions in some respects such as lack of multi-screens, threads, layers concept, strange result in collide methods( it makes me have to create my own collide methods by App Inventor, and performance lost), and so on. <br />
App Inventor can't be used to create complex apps yet, but I'm sure that with collaborative efforts devoted by us, more controls and functions will be included, App Inventor by all means will get a new height step by step.

## Experience with teams, online developer communities, and large code bases ##
I've worked with my 6 schoolmates on an Android Project @here, and I am responsible for mobile development. This project won The Most Practical Value Award, as I mentioned before. We created the prototype together in our summer vacation, and after that vacation, we lived in 3 different cities, we continued to do our jobs. We used email, FTP and IM tools to discussed problem and transferred project files on internet. We worked fine, and we finally won this award. It’s a very pleasurable experience, thanks everybody!
